						At VIERS, you are "in nature", you are part of the eco-system. You are just minutes from being able to hike to a mountain top or swim in the Caribbean Sea. The area around VIERS has an ecological diversity that has drawn visitors with an interest in just about every aspect of its surrounding environment including (but are not limited to): students from kindergarten through university, researchers and teachers; botanists and artists; historians and geologists; hikers and snorkelers; divers and kayakers; star gazers and bird watchers.  VIERS has hosted NASA scientists, scout groups, family reunions and church retreats. VIERS offers organized programs or you can follow your own. VIERS is not a hotel or a resort -  VIERS is a biology field station.

						VIERS was established by the College of the Virgin Islands (now the University of the Virgin Islands) in November 1966 as the Virgin Islands Ecological Research Station. In 1992, the field station’s name was changed to Virgin Islands Environmental Resource Station to reflect the center’s commitment to providing environmental education.  The field station’s laboratory and researcher’s residence were originally housed in the Bay Rum Mill Ruins on Little Lameshur Bay until moving to the present site in 1970.<br /><br />

						The cabins were built in the fall of 1968 by the U.S. Navy Seabees for Project Tektite, an underwater habitat and research project which was conducted in 1969 and 1970. The experiment not only provided opportunities for marine research, particularly on the behavior and ecology of reef fauna and reef sedimentology, but also provided data for a variety of behavioral, biomedical and engineering studies. The project was sponsored jointly by the U. S. Department of the Interior, U. S. Navy, National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the General Electric Company with support from VIERS staff. At the end of Project Tektite II in 1970, the cabins were transferred to the University of the Virgin Islands to expand the field station. In 2006, the Tektite Underwater Habitat Museum was established at VIERS.

						St. John is about 20 square miles in size, 90% of it consisting of tropical forest. The Virgin Islands National Park occupies almost three fifths of the island. VIERS is located in a lowland Antillean tropical dry forest at the base of Bordeaux Mountain within the Virgin Islands National Park and UNESCO Biosphere Reserve, which offer protection for the various pristine habitats. Semi-deciduous vegetation give way at higher elevations to tropical moist forests. Native flora still predominate with few introduced trees. Adjacent to the tree covered field station are two sheltered bays with coral reefs and seagrass beds, bordered by stands of mangroves.<br /><br />
						
						VIERS is situated on the remote southern shore of St. John at Lameshur Bay. Directly to the south are Great Lameshur Bay and Little Lameshur Bay which are divided by Yawzi Point. Cruz Bay, the main community of St. John, is a 45 minute drive (17 miles) from VIERS. St. John, the smallest of the three U.S. Virgin Islands, is accessible by ferry to Cruz Bay from St. Thomas (STT) which has an airport.
